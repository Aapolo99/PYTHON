Data Types
## Integer
An integer, or int, is a whole number. It has no decimal point and contains the number 0,
positive and negative counting numbers. If we were counting the number of people on the bus or
the number of jellybeans in a jar, we would use an integer.

## Float
A floating-point number, or a float, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractions
or precise measurements. If you were measuring the length and width of the couch, calculating the
test score percentage, or storing a baseball playerâ€™s batting average, we would use a float
instead of an int.
